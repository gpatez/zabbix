# Zabbix application running via Docker!
I decided to create these files in order to help anyone who needs an easy and fast Zabbix application.
## Summary
The entire structure of the containers was based on the official documentation available on the official [Zabbix website](https://www.zabbix.com/container_images) and the images used are available on the official [Zabbix profile](https://hub.docker.com/u/zabbix) on the Docker Hub.
